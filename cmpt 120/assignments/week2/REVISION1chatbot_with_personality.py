# notes: (suggestions, noting mistakes, noting wrongs)
# 1) i don't have an "else" within the block of "else" in the Confirming Pronouns section. so, if someone mistyped something, it would go straight to the Confirming Name section.
# 2) i could have done the "print(rndmResponse_userName)" at the end of the "if/elif/else" statements and that would have reduced the clutter.
# 3) LMAO, i realized i fixed my 1) suggestion in the confirming username section. oh well, i was rushing, so it was a time
